> The Seoul Night Bus, also known as the "Owl Bus," is the brand name of the cityâ€™s intra-city buses that run nine routes exclusively from midnight to 5:00 a.m. Like an owl, animated in the dark with its yellow-glowing eyes, the "Owl Bus" was born to make Seoulâ€™s public transportation service ceaseless, carrying the cityâ€™s late night commuters.
