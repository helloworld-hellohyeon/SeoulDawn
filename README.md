The Seoul Night Bus, also known as the "Owl Bus," is the brand name of the cityâ€™s intra-city buses that run nine routes exclusively from midnight to 5:00 a.m. Like an owl, animated in the dark with its yellow-glowing eyes, the "Owl Bus" was born to make Seoulâ€™s public transportation service ceaseless, carrying the cityâ€™s late night commuters.

This service is protecting women who go back home at late night with scouts. It can prevent crimes against women. Also, this service aims to strengthen local patrols so that women can live in comfort. Call **120** before you get to the station where you take off and scouts will wait near the station for you.
